## Local testing

Loading the data for the line chart is liable to fail because of https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors/CORSRequestNotHttp .  If the chart doesn't display, then we have at least two options:

* Put code on github.io and test there
* Run a local web server

Setting up a local server should be easy with Python.  Simply open a command line window, go to this folder, type `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1883` (for Python 2) or `python -m http.server 1883` (for Python 3) or `python3 -m http.server 1883` (to explicitly select Python3 in an environment that also has Python 2 installed), and leave that session running.

Then the page should be available at http://localhost:1883/ (of course you can change the number).

## Formatting the chart

Exactly where to edit options for the chart can be a bit confusing, so here's a primer:

**Text positioning**: this is set by various `.attr(...)` lines in the `drawChart()` function in the function.js file in /scripts, so that it can position everything relative to the size of the chart area.

**Y axis label colours**: these are defined by the `chartData` object in the function.js file in /scripts.  This is done here because that's the easiest way to have a single place to edit which controls labels and line colours together.

**Which data series are loaded by default**: same `chartData` object as above.

**Text sizes and styling**: look for rules starting with `#chart` in the CSS, *except for the Y axis label colours*.
